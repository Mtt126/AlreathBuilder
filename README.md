# AlreathBuilder
The builder program for Alreath, my WIP MMORPG

This software will produce the data to be converted at runtime for every item that exists. 
This program was make to be external to allow for creation of data on a whim, to be later imported into the game.
This also allows the creation of data to be passed off to others easily without in game verification causing issues if something had an issue.

This program can create Items, LootTables, Jobs, Quests, NPCs. This will mainly handle stats of each, with models being assigned at a later date.
It might include the model setup once the other components are finished.
